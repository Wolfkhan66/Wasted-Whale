# Wasted-Whale
Wasted Whale will be a game based on 'Canyon Bunny' by Suryakumar Balakrishnan Nair and Andreas Oehlke from their book 'Learning LibGDX Game Development - Second Edition'. 
This project is an attempt to learn the proper way of setting up and creating a game in LibGDX the way the developers meant it to be done, and to learn some new tricks along the way.

Canyon Bunny is a 2d side scrolling jump and run game, where the player is a bunny head that has to collect coins and feathers which are randomly generated.
To make the project my own i will be developing 'Wasted Whale' where you play as a whale collecting beers and cocktails.

The game world is presented in a 2D-side view to the player. The view will scroll horizontally to the right-hand side when the player character moves forward. The background shows distant underwater canyons and seacreatures and boats and the top of the ocean. The bottom of the level is filled with deep black representing the depths of the ocean and will instantly kill the player on contact.

The players character will move on and jump over to random rocks, sticking out of the water. The widh and height will be different to make the game more challenging. The player is only in control of a jump button, which will keep the automatically forward-moving player from falling into the deadly depths.

The level will be rndomly populated with collectible items consisting of beers, spirits and cocktails. collecting beers and spirits will increase the players score whilst cocktails will power up the player granting them the ability to swim for a limited time.

Below is the Class Diagram for Canyon Bunny, of which Wasted Whale will be following during its developmental phase:

Over the course of the book i will cover the following:

Gathering Resources - ie texture atlases, handling level data, creating a custom app icon

Making a Scene - creating game objects, implementing a level loader, implementing a Gui

Adding Actors - implementing actor game objects, adding game logic such as collision detection

Menus and Options -  Managing multiple screens, exploring scene2D UI, using Scenegraphs, building the main menu and options screens

Special Effects - particle systems, linear interpolation smoothing, paralex scrolling, enhancing the screens GUI

Screen Transitions - interpolation algorithms, fade transition, slide transition, slice transition

Managing Music and Sound Effects - playing back music and sound effects, accessing an audio device directily, using sound generators

Advanced Programming Techniques - simulating physics with Box2D, Working with Shaders, Alternative input controls

Animations - Manipulating actors through actions, Animating the menu screen, using sequences of images for animation
